# Welcome to the Firefly III Data Importer on Github!

:+1::tada: Thank you for taking the time to contribute something to the Firefly III Data Importer!

## Bugs

First of all: thank you for reporting a bug instead of ditching the tool altogether. If you find a bug, include as many log files and details as you think
are necessary. Bugs have a lot of priority!

## Installation problems

Please take the time to read the [documentation of Firefly III](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/) or the
[documentation of the data importer (TODO)](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/csv) and make sure you search through closed issues for the problems
other people have had. Your problem may be among them! If not, open an issue, and I will help where I can.
